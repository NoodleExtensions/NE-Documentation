# Contributing Guidelines

Please contact cal117#2214 to become an official contributor.

We accept PRs from forks, but they will have to be reviewed by at-least 3 contributors.

Use imgur or a safe CDN if you want to include images in the guide.

Use `.dev/view.html` to preview markdown files.

## Tips

We use **[Bulma](https://bulma.io/)** as our css framework. Feel free use css and html in your markdown files. Scripts inside markdown are not permitted unless an exception needs to be made.
