# Using Mod Assistant

[Mod Assistant](https://github.com/Assistant/ModAssistant/releases/latest) is a piece of software that makes installing mods extremely easy, if you don't have it yet, It's advised that you download it.

When you open Mod Assistant, you first need to agree to the terms and conditions of using it. After you do that, you can access the mods tab on the left. It should look something like this (different mods are available for different versions).

Now, to install Noodle Extensions, you need to find the mod under the "Gameplay" category and then press the square on the left so there's a checkmark in it.
  
 **IF THE MOD ISN'T THERE, IT MEANS IT ISN'T UPDATED FOR THE LATEST VERSION!**
